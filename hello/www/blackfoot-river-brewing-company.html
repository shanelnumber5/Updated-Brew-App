            <p>1993 was an important year for Brian and Brad. That is the year they decided to give up drinking beer.
                Give up drinking bad beer that is. What followed was a couple of years of brewing like maniacs in Brad’s
                basement. Brian and Brad soon discovered
                that not only was it possible to make great tasting beer, but it was also great fun. And judging from
                the many friends who magically appeared on brew night it was easy to see that good beer and good friends
                were a good combination.</p>

            <p>In May of 1998, the dreams of a brewery were coming to fruition in a recently vacated garage building
                located next door to Miller’s Crossing in Downtown Helena. With lots of creativity, loads of hard work,
                and tons of help and encouragement
                from many friends, Blackfoot River Brewing Company became a functional brewery. The first test batch of
                beer was brewed on December 1st, 1998. The brewery received its federal brewery license on December 31st
                and has been busy making great
                beer.
