            <p>During prohibition, the Peterson family trekked thousands of miles across the country to find a new home
                for one-of-kind craft beer… just kidding, we’re not that cool.</p>

            <p> Meadowlark’s creation came about like any other American dream, it was just that, a dream. Our founder,
                Travis, an avid craft beer “researcher”, moved home to Sidney, Montana in 2010 to help with the other
                family business Sidney Red-E-Mix,
                which is when the real encouragement from his parents came into play. Sidney, a small town in Eastern
                Montana was ready for some locally made beer. As with the rest of the country, Sidneyites, Sidneyers,
                the people of Sidney, were becoming
                more aware of and thirsty for craft beer. Travis and family saw this new “thirst” very inline with their
                new goals and dreams, and so the journey began.</p>
