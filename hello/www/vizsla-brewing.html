            <p>Located in North-Central Montana, Vizsla Brewing offers a family friendly atmosphere with an array of craft beers. There are 8 beers on tap at all times and we are constantly working on introducing new flavors and styles to our taps. Vizsla
                Brewing is not one to turn down fun! We offer shuffle board along with a variety of board and card games to accompany your cold beers. We are always working on brining in local entertainment from musician to comedians to add a little more
                to our beautiful tap room. Vizsla Brewing is also working on partnering with local area food vendors on a monthly basis as well as beer pairings and diners for a new dining experience. Vizsla Brewing offers private events as well.</p>

            <p>Vizsla Brewing opened in the fall of 2018 in the Holiday Village Mall in Havre, MT. While we may be the "new kids on the block", Vizsla Brewing has steeped up to show that we can run with the big dogs by becoming the 2019 Montana Brewery of
                the Year. We brought home three, yes THREE gold medals for our beers as well as a Silver from the U.S. Open Beer Championship.</p>

            <p>Whether you are new to the area, coming to visit, or just live down the street, Vizsla Brewing is a great place for you and your family.</p>
