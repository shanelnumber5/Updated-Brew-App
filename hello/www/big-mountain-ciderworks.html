            <p> Our orchard and cider house is located in Kalispell, Montana near the beautiful Flathead lake and Glacier National Park. We love working our farm and providing for our friends and family in the area. Our new cider house and taproom is now
                open. Come by and experience it for yourself.</p>

            <p>We planted our first orchard in 2006. We wanted to grow unique varieties that were unavailable locally and have been providing fresh fruit for our friends since then. We ended up with a lot of apples and decided that converting our extra apples
                to hard cider was the most efficient and sustainable way to use our fruit. We experimented with different varieties to see what would grow best and in 2012, and every year thereafter, planted a much larger orchard to grow the best apples
                to make cider.</p>

            <p>Most of our family has farmed since the turn of the (other) last century. We still honor hard work and respect for the land as did our parents and grandparents. If you appreciate fresh fruit, juice or hard cider, stop by and share the fruits
                of our labor. </p>
