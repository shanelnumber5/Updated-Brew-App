            <p>IN 1996, AN IDEA WAS BORN to start a brewery in west-central Montana with a name that reflected the region’s rich agricultural tradition. Thus, Harvest Moon Brewing set up operations in Belt, a rural community located 20 miles southeast of
                Great Falls. Why Belt? This small town is centrally located with respect to Montana’s major metropolitan areas, and it offers the charm and potential that comes only with small towns. More importantly, Belt’s water supply comes from the
                Madison Aquifer, also the source for world-class springs in Great Falls and Lewistown. Because of this water’s purity, the municipal supply system in Belt is not chlorinated or treated as most other city water supply systems. Pumped directly
                from the aquifer, the water is available to use straight from the tap without treatment or filtering.
