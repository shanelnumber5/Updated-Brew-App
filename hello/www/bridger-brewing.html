            <p>Founded in Bozeman, Montana in 2013, Bridger Brewing was born from a love of beer, an appreciation of
                good food and the desire to create a community gathering place. With locations in Bozeman and Three
                Forks, we are rooted in places we love
                and thirsty for new adventures.</p>

            <p> Inspired by the pioneer spirits of those who came before us, three men set out to create a place for
                people to gather, share a pint and a story. The idea was simple: brew good, do good. Now, with two
                locations, live events and an ever-growing
                menu of daring beers, the Bridger crew is just as excited to share a pint with you as we were on the day
                we opened.</p>
