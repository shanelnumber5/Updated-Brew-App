            <p>At OddPitch Brewing our focus is to be on the forefront of creativity and innovation in the craft beer
                industry. Along with our flagship offerings, we maintain a rotating line up of experimental, traditional
                and often times, simply odd beers.</p>

            <p> We also have a large barrel-aging program. We have sourced barrels that previously held wine and spirits
                from regional producers to age our beer. Most of our wine barrels are used for aging our wide range of
                sour beers and our spirits barrels
                house everything from Saisons to Stouts.</p>

            <p>OddPitch Brewing has a lot of love and respect for the Missoula community and the great state of Montana.
                We pride ourselves on sourcing as many of our ingredients from local producers as we can. There are so
                many amazing people, doing amazing
                things that we can't resist sharing what they do with you!</p>

            <p>Giving back to the community has been a priority since the beginning. Without you, we wouldn't be here!
