            <p>Blue Ridge Brewing is a new brewery located in Malta, MT. Owners, Bryan and Brianna, developed a love for craft beer while visiting different breweries around the state. What started as a hobby, soon became a passion and they had an idea of
                bringing the brewery scene to their little hometown. “We started to see more and more breweries popping up in little towns like our own, and dreamt of the day that Malta could have a brewery of it’s own. I like to think that Malta and
                surrounding Phillips County communities are full of beer-lovers and when you come from a small town, supporting local and having so much pride for your hometown and state, just goes hand in hand with what breweries stand for. Community
                over Corporation.” -Brianna Shores</p>
