            <p>Red Lodge, Montana has a long history with beer. Before the times of Prohibition, Red Lodge Brewing
                Company made great local beer. Many years later, Sam Hoffmann started Red Lodge Ales Brewing Company in
                downtown Red Lodge. By using soft,
                glacial water, heated by a solar thermal array, adding Montana grown and malted barley and naturally
                cooled by cold Beartooth Mountain air, Red Lodge Ales produces quality beer for today’s discerning beer
                lovers. </p>

            <p> Located on the 22nd block of Historic Montana Avenue our sister establishment fills an expansive
                warehouse that has played host to many businesses including a tractor showroom and most recently United
                Glass. The rear (North-side) of the interior
                is the production facility—our cider mill. The key to great cider is using ripe, hand-picked fruit and
                we have a massive cooler full of it. We source our apples from Montana, Michigan and Oregon and we
                consider them to be some of the best
                in the world. We press our apples on Wednesdays between October and March so come on down and watch the
                process.</p>
