            <p>The Missoula and Montana brewery scene has been growing over the years and has become a great pastime for all to enjoy. We love all of our local breweries we have here in Missoula and across the great state of Montana. We feature all the finest
                beers from around Missoula and our state, as well as a mix of beers from the Northwest, and around the world. We feature exciting beers you would not have the opportunity to try unless you are here. Our staff is knowledgeable and up to
                date on all the beer trends and on all the beers we will have on tap. Our wine selection, for the non-beer drinkers, features wines on tap as well as bottled wines to enjoy as well. Whether it's a glass of wine, a pint of beer, or just
                stopping in to get your growler filled, you will enter the doors to a vast, and ever-changing selection of beverages.
