            <p>In November 1875, the first beers were brewed on what would become the site of the Butte Brewing Co. in uptown Butte, Montana Territory. Between 1880 and 1885, the Butte Brewing Co. grew with the raucous 'Silver Camp on the Big Butte.' In
                1886, German brewer Henry Muntzer, and later Irishman J.V. Collins, would transform the fledgling brewery into Montana's iconic leader in business, community involvement, and of course as the manufacturer of 'Butte Beer - The Perfect Brew".
                The Butte Brewing Co. has faithfully slaked the Mining City's thirst through world wars, mining strikes and closures, political upheavals, and martial law, corporate mining skullduggery, and national prohibition. The acclaimed Butte Beer
                became synonyms with the tough, independent-minded citizens, of the Richest Hill on earth. By the 1960s the brewery had closed, but the spirit of the great Butte Beer remained. The Butte Brewing Co. reopened its doors in 2015. Once again,
                the Butte Brewing Co. is producing high quality brews in celebration of more than 130 years of tradition.</p>
