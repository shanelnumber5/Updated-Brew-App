            <p>It all started about 22 years ago when our accomplished brewer, Ron Kalvig, began brewing up his own
                recipes in a converted garage. With great success, many of Ron's friends began to ask, "Dude, when are
                you going to open your own brewery?"</p>

            <p>The doors to Canyon
                Creek Brewing were finally opened on December 19th, 2013. Our roughly 6,000 square foot facility boasts
                plenty of seating, two bars, two patios, and a gorgeous, hand-crafted, outdoor fireplace.</p>

            <p>One of the few taprooms located on the West End of Billings, Canyon Creek provides an environment fit for
                a beer after work or a party on the weekends. We offer a wide selection of tasty beers and our staff is
                always ready to give a recommendation
                or two! From the avid beer connoisseurs to first-time triers, there is something for everyone!</p>
