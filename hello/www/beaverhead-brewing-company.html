            <p>Beaverhead Brewing Company is owned and operated by Brett Maki.</p>

            <p>The name for Beaverhead Brewing Company comes from the original brewery in Dillon which operated in the
                late 1800’s and early 1900’s. Little is known about the original Beaverhead Brewery (Dillon Brewery) but
                newspaper clipping mention it
                was regarded as making the “Finest Beer.” Owned and operated at one time by Henry Burfiend and his
                brother, the Brewery closed in 1919 at the start of Prohibition. The Brewery was located on the south
                side of Dillon near where the medical
                clinic is located today.</p>
