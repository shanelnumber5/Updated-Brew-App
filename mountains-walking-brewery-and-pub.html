            <p>Gustav Dose, the founder of Mountains Walking and director of brewing, grew up in Taiwan and Japan and
                studied brewing around the world. When it came time to put down roots, he and his wife decided to raise
                their family in Bozeman. Gustav
                is committed to the ancient traditions of brewing and is interested in beers made with living cultures
                that have naturally lower alcohol and sugar levels. He believes that new and surprising discoveries come
                from watching the brewing process
                very closely and learning from the practice of making beer.</p>
