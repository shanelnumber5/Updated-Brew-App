            <p>Neptune’s Brewery is named after the Roman god of the sea. The god’s name comes from several words
                combined to connote the marriage of heaven and earth, which might be interpreted in modern times as
                meaning of the best of both worlds.</p>

            <p> Our motto is Drink Like God, meaning drink the best! God’s, although sometimes viewed as angry and
                vengeful, are also looked at as strong leaders and caretakers of their people. We prefer to emulate the
                community caretaker portion of the Roman
                deity and be known by our employees as a great place to work as well as being a community gathering
                center, where we support and enhance our local culture</p>

            <p>Neptune’s Brewery is a quaint, sea-themed oasis in the small mountain town of Livingston, MT. We serve a
                variety of brewed-on-site hand crafted beers</p>

            <p>We hold our community near and dear… Everything we do is in an effort to improve our town, the lives of
                the people living here, and our employees.</p>
