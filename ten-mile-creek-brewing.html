            <p>Ten Mile Creek Brewery is a seven barrel brewery located in Helena, MT down on the historic Last Chance
                Gulch Walking Mall. Snug between The Hawthorn Bottle Shop and Helena’s favorite confectionery, The
                Parrot. Founded by three local Montanans,
                Jordan Keltz, Ethan Kohoutek, and Riley Tubbs, at the age of 24. Opening our doors in October of 2015,
                Ten Mile Creek Brewery became the third brewery in Helena.</p>

            <p> Our namesake “Ten Mile Creek” comes from our most important ingredient, water. The creek is in the beer.
                The watershed supplies most of Helena, including our brewery, with clean, great tasting water making for
                a excellent craft beer. Each
                batch has Montana grown barley and all other ingredients are sourced as local as possible. Because of
                the smaller size our system we are able to experiment often with new brews. Our goal with the small
                brewery is that each visit into the
                taproom gives you something new to taste and always a great environment to be in.</p>
